## Basics


We wish to solve the equation for smallest or largest eigenvalues fo a huge real symmetric matrx A.

$$ Ax = \lambda x $$

The basic algorithm involves formation of a tridiagonal matrix using [Gram-Schmidt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram%E2%80%93Schmidt_process) process.

## Concept 

The tridiagonal matrix can be formed using the orthogonalisation procedure.
The Tridiagonal matrix follows the condition

$$ AQ = QT $$


$$
T = 
\begin{bmatrix}
     \alpha         & \beta    	& 0 		& 0 		& 0 		& 0 \\
     \beta       	& \alpha    & \beta 	& 0 		& 0 		& 0 \\
     0       		& \beta    	& \alpha 	& \beta 	& 0 	 	& 0 \\
     0       		& 0   		& \beta 	& \alpha 	& \beta 	& 0 \\
	 \vdots 		& \vdots 	& \vdots 	& \ddots 	& \ddots 	& \vdots \\ 
     0         		& 0  		& 0 	 	& 0   		& \alpha 	& \beta \\
     0         		& 0  		& 0 	 	& 0			& \beta 	& \alpha
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Where Q is the set of eigenvectors.

## Algorithm

Basic algorithm involves formation of the tridiagonal matrix elements $\alpha$ and $\beta$

## Convergence


> convergence is reached when the last element $\beta$ of  **T**  goes to 0.
> *But it is not necessary to wait for the convergece to reach till there*.

In is known that m eigenvalues can be obtained from the m sized T matrix but doents seem to be true in my case.
Only one postitive eigenvalue is reached.

For the lowest eigenvalues search ppl talk about shifting the matrix A by a factor $\lambda $ which is the highest eigenvalue. 
But this does not seem to be working for me in the python code.
In the matlab code just substuitutuibg the matrix with -A did the thing
This almost worked in my python code but the convergence was very poor, never achieved and eigenvaleus differ from actual in the range 0f 0.001; hence not good.

In python code what did the trick is using I - A instead of -A

code snippet:

```python
def Lanczos(A,q,max_iter):
   q0 = 0;
   r = q
   b = np.linalg.norm(q)
   Q = np.empty((n,0))
   Tk = np.zeros((max_iter+2,max_iter+2))
   alpha = []
   beta = []
   for i in range(0,max_iter):
      q = r/b
      r = np.dot(A,q)
      r = r - np.dot(b,q0)
      a = np.dot(q.T,r)
      r = r - np.dot(q,a)
      b = np.linalg.norm(r)
      q0 = q
      Q = np.bmat([Q,q])
      Tk[i][i] = float(a)
      Tk[i][i+1] = b
      Tk[i+1][i] = b
      T = Tk[0:i+1,0:i+1]
      evalT,evecT = np.linalg.eigh(T)
      res = abs(b*evecT[i,i])
      y = -Q*evecT
      #print res
      #print(evalT)
      if res < 1E-9:
         break
   eva=evalT[i]
   evc=y[:,i]
   return eva, evc

```
